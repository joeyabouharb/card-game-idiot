## Week 2

Major progress have been made in the application and most of the original requirements have been met, with the AI being the only major feature in progress. Minor issues with the functionality of the application need to be addressed later, as certain game rules that were not included in the initial requirements stage like setting user hand at game start as, playing multiples and bombing the deck with "4 of a kind". As we are close to the deadline, these features may not be added into the game. Regarding the design of the AI, a mixture of both randomisation and conditionals are being implemented to allow the AI the ability to act logically, while also allowing a small chance of failing spectacularly and picking a bad choice.

Update: playing multiples was implemented successfully, due to time constraints and limitations in the command line interface, changing user hand could not be implemented on time.
