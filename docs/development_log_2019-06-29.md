## Week 1

It's been a stressful week of coding, and my card game is in the stage where the basic rules of the game are in implementation. There have been certain problematic error's been thrown during runtime, where variables were having issues unpacking multiple returns from functions as well as issues with circular imports during as well. splitting up the functionality of prompt_user_turn and having the switching between user turns be handled by a seperate function. revising the flow of the application, were input validation for users have been seperated from the actions module, allowed for better flexibility and removed the issue with circular imports
